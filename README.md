I made a new page ProductCard.jsx
I called fakestore API to show products.
I used MaterialUI to create attractive and responsive cards by keeping UI/UX rules in mind.
As the API call doesn't provide INSTOCK/OUTOFSTOCK value so I used ratings to give the instock text colors. I can my own API as well where we can give INSTOCK/OUTOFSTOCK Values.
